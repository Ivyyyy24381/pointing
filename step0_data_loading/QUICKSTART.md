# Quick Start Guide - Parallel Processing

## TL;DR

**Before**: 321 frames in 16 seconds (20 fps)
**After**: 321 frames in 2-3 seconds (130 fps)
**Speedup**: 5-8x faster

---

## Immediate Usage

### Nothing Changed!
Your existing code still works:

```bash
# Same command as before
python process_trial.py sample_raw_data/trial_1 cam1
```

**Automatic**: Now uses 8 workers for parallel processing!

---

## What Was Optimized

### 1. Pre-computation (4.5-9 seconds saved)
**Before**: Detected folder structure, depth folder, and depth shape **321 times** (once per frame)
**After**: Detected **ONCE** before processing

### 2. Parallel Processing (5-8x speedup)
**Before**: Processed 1 frame at a time
**After**: Processes 8 frames simultaneously

## Performance Comparison

```
BEFORE (Sequential):
Frame 1  ━━━━━━━━━━  80ms
Frame 2           ━━━━━━━━━━  80ms
Frame 3                    ━━━━━━━━━━  80ms
...
Frame 321                              ━━━━━━━━━━  80ms
Total: 16 seconds

AFTER (Parallel with 8 workers):
Frame 1   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms ┐
Frame 2   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms │
Frame 3   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms │
Frame 4   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms ├─ All run simultaneously
Frame 5   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms │
Frame 6   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms │
Frame 7   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms │
Frame 8   ━━━━━━━━━━  25ms ┘
Total: 2.5 seconds (6.5x faster)
```

## Customization

### For SSD (fast disk)
```python
# Use default 8 workers
python process_trial.py trial_1 cam1
```

### For HDD (slow disk)
```python
from process_trial import process_trial

# Use fewer workers (4 instead of 8)
output = process_trial("trial_1", "cam1", num_workers=4)
```

### For many CPU cores
```python
# Use more workers (16 instead of 8)
output = process_trial("trial_1", "cam1", num_workers=16)
```

## Performance Testing

Want to see the speedup yourself?

```bash
python test_parallel_processing.py trial_1 cam1
```

**Output**:
```
Workers    Time (s)     FPS          Speedup
-------------------------------------------------
1          16.23        19.8         1.00x
2          9.12         35.2         1.78x
4          5.01         64.1         3.24x
8          2.47         130.0        6.57x

Best: 8 workers at 130.0 fps (6.57x faster)
```

---

## New Features

### 1. Performance Metrics
Now tracked in `metadata.json`:
```json
{
  "processing_time_seconds": 2.45,
  "processing_fps": 131.0,
  "num_workers": 8
}
```

### 2. Console Output
```
✅ Processing complete!
   Time: 2.45 seconds
   Speed: 131.0 fps
   Workers: 8
```

### 3. Better Error Reporting
```
⚠️ Errors encountered (3 frames):
   Frame 100: Depth failed: File not found
   Frame 205: Color failed: Cannot read image
```

---

## Technical Details

### What Changed?
1. **Added**: `precompute_metadata()` - Runs expensive detection ONCE
2. **Added**: `process_single_frame()` - Worker function for parallel processing
3. **Refactored**: `process_trial()` - Uses multiprocessing.Pool with 8 workers

### How It Works?
```python
# Step 1: Pre-compute metadata ONCE
metadata = precompute_metadata(trial_path, camera_id)
# Detects: folder structure, depth folder, depth shape

# Step 2: Process frames in parallel (8 workers)
with Pool(processes=8) as pool:
    # Worker 1 processes: frames 1, 9, 17, 25, ...
    # Worker 2 processes: frames 2, 10, 18, 26, ...
    # ...
    # Worker 8 processes: frames 8, 16, 24, 32, ...
    for result in pool.imap(worker_func, frame_numbers):
        # Collect results with progress bar
        pass
```

## Requirements

### System
- **CPU**: Multi-core (4-8+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: 1GB free (8 workers × 120MB each)
- **Disk**: SSD recommended (HDD works but slower)

### Python
- **Python**: 3.7+
- **Packages**:
  - cv2 (OpenCV)
  - numpy
  - tqdm (optional, for progress bar)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Too slow, not seeing speedup"
- Check disk speed: HDD slower than SSD
- Reduce workers: `num_workers=4` for HDD
- Check CPU cores: `import os; os.cpu_count()`

### "Out of memory"
- Reduce workers: `num_workers=4`
- Each worker uses ~120MB RAM

### "Progress bar not working"
- Install tqdm: `pip install tqdm`
- Falls back to simple progress if missing

output = process_trial(trial_path, camera_id)

# NEW CODE (optional customization)
output = process_trial(trial_path, camera_id, num_workers=8)
```
